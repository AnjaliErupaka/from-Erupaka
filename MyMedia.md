# Anjali Erupaka
I often listen to songs, and one of my favorite songs is 'gelupu thalupulu' song from the movie Theenmar. It is a Telugu song, a language that is originated to the southern part of India. This song was composed by Manisharma, and the lyrics were penned by Chandrabose. This movie also has many notable tracks. I usually love to hear this song, whenever I feel demotivated and alone. this song has a soothing music and beautiful lyrics. I also suggested many of my friends about the song, and now we all love to hear the track.
