Biryani is a south-asian dish made with basmati rice, meat,vegetables and a mould of flavourful spices. The ambiance ofBawarchi restaurant is often casual and family-friendly. It's known for its focus on providing a comfortable dining experience. I like the odour, spice and taste of Biryani at Bawarchi, which made 'biryani' as my all time favourite.
