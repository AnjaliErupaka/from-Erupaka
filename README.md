Biryani is a south-asian dish made with basmati rice, meat,vegetables and a mould of flavourful spices. The ambiance ofBawarchi restaurant is often casual and family-friendly. It's known for its focus on providing a comfortable dining experience. I like the odour, spice and taste of Biryani at Bawarchi, which made 'biryani' as my all time favourite.

This SQL snippet gives us the information of BETWEEN clause. The BETWEEN command is one of the logical operators in SQL. The BETWEEN command in SQL is used to filter data within a specific range. To compare a value with an exclusive range, we use the comparison operators less than (<) and greater than ( >). The BETWEEN operator is a combination of begin and end values, where end values and begin values are inclusive.

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
